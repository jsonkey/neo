How to use the BitTorrent auto-update feature:
==============================================

Each minor point release should probably have a new key pair
generated, which means that auto-update will work for each mini
version, but that users will have to manually download and install
each new minor point release.

All keys are generated and stored in the auto-update directory inside
the BitTorrent source directory.

To generate a new key pair:
---------------------------

(If you already have a key pair and are rolling a mini version
release, go to step 5)

1. Using generate_key.py, generate a public/private key pair on a
secure machine.  

2. Test that generating and checking the signature is working:
$ sign_file.py file.ext
$ check_signature.py file.ext

3. Make a backup of private.key on a secure medium.  DO NOT check the
private key into any source code repository.

4. Check public.key into the BitTorrent repository.

To roll a new release suitable for auto-update:
-----------------------------------------------

5. Build the installation package for all operating systems that will
support auto-update (currently limited to Windows).  Ensure that the
public.key file is included in the installation package.

6. Generate a torrent file for all installation packages generated in
step 5, and begin seeding them.

7. Use sign_file.py to generate .sign files for each torrent file,
like this:
sign_file.py BitTorrent-X.Y.Z.ext.torrent

8. Copy the .sign and .torrent files to the correct directory on
version.bittorrent.com

9. Change the version file on version.bittorrent.com to reflect the
newly available version.
